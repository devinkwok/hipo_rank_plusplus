five years ago , the question essentially remains unanswered as the difficulty is multifaceted .", "in addition , the composition and modification of the components of the fibre are also likely to affect its plasticity .", "pioneering single - molecule studies have attempted to provide an insight into this fundamental question . using magnetic tweezers to introduce torsional stress into model chromatin fibres bancaud et al", "although such plasticity may not be typical of more condensed , native chromatin fibres , it does provide insight into the buffering capacity of chromatin to supercoiling and its transmission .", "they suggested that supercoiling stress was more problematic for large chromosomes where its dissipation was less easily achieved through chromosome rotation .", "dna supercoiling also has a major role during dna replication and the subsequent condensation and separation of replicated chromosomes .", "this causes intertwining of newly replicated dna molecules behind the fork and the formation of precatenanes .", "this structural change then allows topoisomerase ii to identify and resolve inter - chromosomal but not intra - chromosomal crossovers .", "concomitantly , chromosome compaction starts during s - phase when condensin ii is recruited to replicated regions .", "a renewed interest in supercoiling research is clarifying how it influences nuclear processes and architecture ."], "CLUSTER3": ["the classic example is the  twin supercoiled domain model where elongating rna polymerase , in unwinding the dna , generates positive supercoiling ahead and , in rewinding the dna , generates negative supercoiling in its wake   ( figure 1 ) .", "thus , as in bacteria , eukaryotic chromosomes appear to be organised into structural loops , overlaid with both large ( 100  kb ) supercoiling domains and smaller supercoiling foci at transcription start sites ( figure 2c , d ) .", "rotation and torque could be applied to and measured from the dna by manipulation of the quartz bead whilst its height provided a measure of displacement . upon transcription into a negatively supercoiled template , the polymerase initially relaxed the dna and then introduced positive supercoiling .", "however , a lack of fundamental knowledge of the multilayered structures of its substrate , the chromatin fibre , and given that supercoiling is such an inherently elusive topological force , will probably demand the development of new and innovative experimental approaches ."]}
